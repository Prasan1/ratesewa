# Major: When you are logged in as a doctor, you can open your profile in public view and rate yourself.

1. The webpage is not that fast maybe this is because of the massive data that we have but we will have 20k + doctor profile what will we do?
2. There are several duplicate specialization listed. such as ENT and ENT specialized are the same ENT. No need to keep two category. 
3. We need to be extra careful now. There have been 7 new users in the platform 2 of them were doctors and they haven't created profile yet and their 
   profile is not in the system yet. So I don't know if that created this friction or maybe they will come back. 
4. We have to be very careful on making chnages now . Few people are gainig interest.
