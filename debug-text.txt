DEBUG ISSUE:
=============
1. ✅ RESOLVED: Phone number now shows with green "Show Phone Number" button
   - Click to reveal number
   - Click-to-call on mobile (tel: link)
   - Displays number on desktop

2. Clinic link field - Need clarification:
   - Field EXISTS in admin_doctor_form.html (line 76-86)
   - It's a dropdown select showing all clinics
   - Is it not visible? Or should it be a text input instead of dropdown? 



  
  FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
  ==========================
  
  High‑priority improvements

  - Remove hardcoded secrets and production‑unsafe defaults: SECRET_KEY fallback and a real default Resend key are in app.py; move all secrets to env and fail fast if missing; set
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True in prod and gate debug by env instead of app.run(debug=True) in app.py.
  - Eliminate state‑changing GET endpoints to avoid CSRF risk: /admin/appointment/<id>/confirm, /admin/appointment/<id>/cancel, and /admin/toggle_featured/<id> should be POST+CSRF and
    ideally require explicit confirmation in the UI (app.py).
  - Remove exposed credentials in docs: admin password in README.md should not be in the repo (even for MVP); point to env/seed instructions instead.

  Security & privacy

  - Add rate limiting for login, review, flag, appointment, and contact endpoints (app.py) to deter brute force and abuse (Flask‑Limiter or similar).
  - Strengthen password policy and add account recovery/email verification (current minimum is 6 chars in app.py and templates).
  - Restrict debug endpoints and admin tooling behind an explicit config flag so they can’t be accidentally exposed in production (app.py routes like /admin/debug/*).

  Data integrity & scalability

  - Add DB‑level constraints for reviews to prevent duplicates (unique on (doctor_id, user_id) in models.py), not just app‑level checks.
  - Add indexes for frequent filters/joins: doctors.city_id, doctors.specialty_id, ratings.doctor_id, ratings.user_id (models.py) to keep search and profile pages fast as data grows.
  - Reduce N+1 queries and Python‑side aggregation for ratings/analytics (app.py); use SQL aggregates or eager loading where lists are iterated.

  Maintainability

  - Split app.py into blueprints (auth, admin, doctors, reviews, billing) and move business logic into service modules. The file is 3.8k+ lines and mixes concerns, which makes regressions
    more likely.
  - Centralize config by environment (Dev/Prod/Test) in config.py and avoid per‑route configuration in app.py.

  Product/ops

  - Add structured logging instead of print() for R2 and upload paths (r2_storage.py, upload_utils.py) so production logs are searchable.
  - Expand automated tests beyond test_admin_users.py: auth, review flow, and admin actions are the highest‑value targets.
