1. City is too many and scrolling down to select one is a problem
2. Upper case lower case capitalization are mixed in doctors name this needs to be arranged nicely.
3. I don't know how we got over 1000 cities in Nepal, i do't know fi we could arrange these data based on major cities instead of smaller city. Like we have separate 
   listing for kathmandu and kathmandu metro politial city. This should have been the same. 
4. In phone, the searching experience is little messy. Sometime entering name resets the form. i don't know if this is due to the phone UI or keyboard or something else.
5. movinng from bottom to top is just scrolling and its time consuming I don't if ther's some good way to navigate end and begining of the page both 
   in cell phone and in computer.
6. While editing once profile, doctor can not edit theri name, I think this is intentional
7. When I open an app on browser or cell phone it automatically moves to the Doctors list. Users should start from the top(I guess)
8. in experience section of the card, I see 0 years and null years. People will not understand null years. 
9. I got first request to put phone number, hopefully doctors will claim their profile and put phone number.
10. some of the users in Nepal were asking can we comment on Nepali, i don't know if there's unicode feature available. I think they can copy and paste nepali 
    font right? 
11. Please give #10 a low priority for now. The biggest one is : the app should be fast in cell phone as well as desktop.
