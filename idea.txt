This is a doctor rating platform for developing nation like Nepal. 
Registered user can comment and rate doctor they visit based on what they feel.
The page is simple flask, jquery based page which has list of doctors and the 
users can search doctors in their locality by usig a drop down selection and 
selectiing city and specialist. They can see the pharmacy the doctor is 
available for duty and contact information. In Nepal, small pharmacy can 
schedule once or twice a week or once or twice a month or daily specialist 
visit for few hours and take patient. That way both make money. 

We need to think about how we monitize this: 
I thought of putting add on the right side of the panel but 
that will not be enough, I also thought about listing 
featured profile for a doctors, there card appears as featured 
when users serach for a doctor in that locality and the first appearance 
would be their profile. 

We need to style a little bit on the user profile who is logged in as this looks cheap as of now. 
we also need a machanism so one user do not keep rating the doctors randomly based on how they feel
instead of based on the service they provided to them.

Let's start with this.
