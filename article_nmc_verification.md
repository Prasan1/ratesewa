# How to Verify Your Doctor's NMC Number Online: A Complete Guide for Patients in Nepal

In 2016, Nepal Medical Council made a shocking discovery: out of 1,000 doctors investigated, 109 had obtained their medical degrees using fake academic certificates. Even more alarming—17 doctors were arrested for practicing with completely fraudulent credentials, and four were treating patients illegally without any NMC license at all.

One particularly disturbing case involved someone who had attempted the NMC licensing exam 29 times. After failing repeatedly, instead of trying for a 30th time, he simply started "practicing medicine" without ever obtaining a license.

These aren't just statistics. These are real people treating real patients—people like you and your family—without legitimate medical qualifications.

As a patient in Nepal, you have the right to know whether your doctor is genuinely qualified to treat you. This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to verify your doctor's NMC number online and protect yourself from unqualified practitioners.

## Why Verifying Your Doctor's NMC Number Matters

### It's Not Just Recommended—It's Your Safety

The Nepal Medical Council (NMC) certificate is legally mandatory for any medical graduate to practice modern medicine in Nepal. Yet despite this clear requirement, cases of medical fraud continue to surface across the country.

When you verify a doctor's NMC number, you're confirming that:

- **Their medical degree is legitimate** and from a recognized institution
- **Their academic credentials have been verified** by government authorities
- **They've passed the NMC licensing examination** that tests medical competency
- **They meet the professional standards** set by Nepal Medical Council

### The Legal Consequences Are Severe

Nepal takes medical fraud seriously. Under the Nepal Medical Council Act, anyone found practicing medicine without proper credentials faces harsh penalties:

- **3 years imprisonment** for practicing during suspension or without license
- **Murder charges** if a patient dies due to treatment by an unlicensed practitioner

In 2016, charge sheets were filed against 12 fake doctors, and the NMC began an unprecedented effort to verify the academic credentials of all 17,000+ registered doctors in Nepal. This massive verification drive involved coordination with the Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) and the Office of the Controller of Examinations (OCE).

### Not Everyone in a White Coat Is a Real Doctor

The reality that many patients don't realize is that some clinics employ unregistered practitioners, some doctors practice with suspended licenses, and academic credential fraud has been well-documented in Nepal's medical education system.

A 2015 investigation by Nepal Medical Council revealed an even deeper problem: 212 doctors were listed as teaching faculty at medical colleges but were actually "phantom faculty"—qualified doctors who existed only on paper during regulatory inspections but never actually trained students.

The bottom line? You cannot assume someone is a legitimate doctor just because they work in a clinic or wear a white coat. Verification is essential.

## What Exactly is an NMC Number?

An NMC number is a unique registration number issued by the Nepal Medical Council to every doctor who successfully completes their medical education and passes the licensing examination. Think of it like a medical license plate—it identifies the doctor in the national registry and confirms their legal right to practice medicine.

### What NMC Registration Confirms

When a doctor has a valid NMC registration number, it means:

1. **Educational Verification**: Their medical degree has been verified as authentic
2. **Examination Success**: They passed the rigorous NMC licensing exam
3. **Credential Review**: Their academic transcripts and certificates were reviewed by authorities
4. **Legal Authorization**: They're legally permitted to practice modern medicine in Nepal

### Types of NMC Registration

The Nepal Medical Council issues different types of registration:

- **Provisional Registration**: Temporary registration issued to new graduates
- **Permanent Registration**: For Nepali medical graduates who complete all requirements
- **Foreign National Doctor (FND) Registration**: For international doctors practicing in Nepal

All types should be verifiable through the NMC system.

## How to Verify a Doctor's NMC Number Online: Step-by-Step Guide

### Method 1: Official Nepal Medical Council Website (Most Authoritative)

This is the primary and most reliable method to verify doctor credentials in Nepal.

**Step 1: Visit the Official NMC Search Portal**

Go to: **https://www.nmc.org.np/search-registered-doctor/**

This is the authoritative database maintained directly by the Nepal Medical Council. While other verification methods exist, this is the official source.

**Step 2: Get the Doctor's NMC Number**

Here's the reality: the NMC search works best (and often only works) when you have the **NMC registration number**. Searching by name alone frequently returns no results or incomplete information.

**Where to find the NMC number:**
- Ask your doctor directly - they should have it readily available
- Look for it displayed in the clinic (often shown with certificates)
- Check the doctor's prescription pad - some doctors print it there
- Find it on the doctor's RankSewa profile if they're verified

**Step 3: Enter the NMC Number**

- Go to the "NMC No" field on the search page
- Enter the registration number carefully
- NMC numbers are typically numeric
- Click "Search"

**Important Note:** Searching by name alone often doesn't work well on the NMC portal. You'll get the most reliable results using the NMC number directly.

**Step 4: Review the Search Results**

When results appear, verify:

- ✅ The name matches your doctor exactly
- ✅ The qualification/degree is displayed
- ✅ The NMC registration number matches what you entered

**What the NMC Portal Does NOT Show:**
- ❌ Registration status (active/suspended) - not displayed
- ❌ Registration date - not shown in search results
- ❌ Detailed practice history

The NMC search is basic but confirms the doctor exists in the official registry with that number and name.

**Step 5: Save the Information**

Take a screenshot or write down:
- The NMC registration number
- The doctor's full name as shown
- The qualifications listed

Keep this for your records.

### Method 2: Using RankSewa (Easier & More Comprehensive)

While the official NMC website is authoritative, it can sometimes be slow or difficult to navigate. RankSewa provides a more user-friendly alternative with additional helpful information.

**Step 1: Visit RankSewa.com**

Go to the RankSewa website and search for doctors by:
- Name
- Specialty
- City or location
- Medical condition

**Step 2: Look for the Verification Badge**

When viewing doctor profiles on RankSewa:
- Look for the "Verified" badge on the profile
- This means RankSewa has cross-checked their NMC registration
- The NMC number is displayed prominently on verified profiles

**Step 3: Access Comprehensive Information**

Beyond just verification, RankSewa provides:
- Patient reviews and ratings from real experiences
- Years of experience in practice
- Clinic locations and contact information
- Educational background and qualifications
- Specialization areas

**Step 4: Verify Independently If Desired**

Even though RankSewa pre-verifies doctors, you can always double-check:
- Copy the NMC number shown on RankSewa
- Verify it on the official NMC website
- Confirm the information matches

This gives you two layers of verification for complete peace of mind.

### Method 3: Direct Contact with Nepal Medical Council

If online searches fail or you need help with complex cases:

**Email Verification:**
- Send a request to: verification@nmc.org.np
- Include the doctor's full name and NMC number if available
- Response typically takes 2-3 business days

**Phone Verification:**
- Call: +977-1-4371954 or +977-1-4377164
- Ask for the verification department
- Provide the doctor's details

**In-Person Verification:**
- Visit NMC office at Bansbari, Kathmandu
- Bring any documents you have
- Office hours: Sunday-Friday (government office hours)

## Red Flags and Warning Signs: When to Be Concerned

### 🚩 Doctor Refuses to Provide NMC Number

Every legitimate doctor in Nepal will have their NMC number readily available. Many display it prominently in their clinic along with their medical degrees. If a doctor:

- Refuses to share their NMC number
- Makes excuses about "privacy" or "not having it handy"
- Gets defensive when asked

This is a major red flag. Legitimate doctors understand that patients have the right to verify credentials.

### 🚩 NMC Number Doesn't Appear in Official Search

If you search for the NMC number on the official portal and:

- No results appear
- The name doesn't match
- The number format looks suspicious

Stop. Do not continue treatment until you verify the situation. The number could be:
- Completely fabricated
- From a different country's medical council (not Nepal Medical Council)
- Belonging to a different doctor entirely

### 🚩 You Cannot Verify Current Status on NMC Portal

Here's a critical limitation: the NMC search portal does NOT show whether a doctor's registration is currently active or has been suspended. Finding a name in the database only confirms they were registered at some point.

**If you have concerns about a doctor's current status:**

- **Contact NMC directly**: verification@nmc.org.np or +977-1-4371954
- **Ask the doctor to show their physical NMC certificate** (it should have issue/renewal date)
- **Check if they've renewed within the 5-year cycle**
- **Look for recent activity** - Are they associated with reputable hospitals?

**Why this matters:** Suspended doctors are legally prohibited from practicing medicine. According to the Nepal Medical Council Act, practicing during suspension carries a 3-year prison sentence. If a patient dies due to treatment by a suspended doctor, it's treated as murder.

### 🚩 Name Doesn't Match Exactly

Minor spelling variations might occur, but significant differences are concerning:

- Different first or last name
- Completely different person's name
- Name in search results doesn't match clinic certificates

Ask the doctor directly about the discrepancy. There might be a legitimate explanation (name change after marriage, etc.), but verify it carefully.

### 🚩 Doctor Claims "NMC Not Required"

Some practitioners might claim:
- "I practice alternative medicine, so I don't need NMC"
- "I'm a consultant, not a practicing doctor"
- "I only do counseling, not medical treatment"

**The truth:** If they're diagnosing conditions, prescribing medications, or providing medical treatment of any kind, they need NMC registration. Alternative medicine practitioners (Ayurveda, homeopathy, etc.) have their own regulatory councils and should still have registration numbers from the appropriate authority.

### What to Do If You Discover a Problem

1. **Stop treatment immediately** if you have concerns about credentials
2. **Contact NMC verification department**: verification@nmc.org.np
3. **Report to authorities** if patients are at immediate risk
4. **Share information** with others who might be affected
5. **Seek care from a verified practitioner** on RankSewa or the NMC registry

## Special Cases You Should Know About

### Foreign-Trained Doctors

Doctors who studied abroad are common in Nepal. They must:
- Obtain Foreign National Doctor (FND) registration from NMC
- Pass the NMC licensing examination
- Have a valid NMC number just like Nepali-trained doctors

You can search for FND doctors on the NMC website, though the process is similar to searching for any registered doctor.

### Specialists and Consultants

Senior doctors with specializations (cardiologists, neurologists, surgeons, etc.) will have:
- Basic MBBS degree
- Advanced degrees: MD (Doctor of Medicine), MS (Master of Surgery), DM (Doctorate of Medicine), MCh (Magister Chirurgiae)
- The same NMC registration requirement

Their NMC number covers all their qualifications. Don't be confused if they have multiple degrees—verify the NMC number, not individual degrees.

### Dentists

Dental practitioners are also registered with the Nepal Medical Council. The same verification process applies:
- They must have NMC registration
- You can search their credentials on the same portal
- They face the same penalties for practicing without registration

### Ayurvedic and Traditional Medicine Practitioners

Practitioners of traditional medicine systems have different regulatory bodies:
- **Ayurvedic doctors**: Registered with Nepal Ayurved Medical Council
- **Homeopathic practitioners**: Have separate registration requirements

While not registered with NMC, they should still have valid registration from the appropriate authority. Ask for their registration number and verify with the relevant council.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does NMC verification take?**

Online verification on the official NMC website is instant—results appear within seconds if you have the NMC number. Note that searching by name alone often doesn't work, so you'll need to get the NMC number from your doctor first. If you contact NMC by email for verification assistance, responses typically take 2-3 business days.

**Q: Can I trust all doctors on RankSewa?**

RankSewa displays NMC numbers for all doctors and marks verified doctors with a verification badge. However, we always recommend that patients independently verify NMC numbers on the official NMC portal for complete confidence. RankSewa makes this easier by displaying the number prominently.

**Q: What if my doctor studied abroad?**

Foreign-trained doctors must still obtain NMC registration to practice in Nepal. They need to pass the NMC licensing examination and will have an NMC number just like locally-trained doctors. Verify their credentials the same way.

**Q: Do I need to verify every time I visit the doctor?**

No. Verify once when choosing a new doctor, and keep the information in your records. You might want to re-verify if:
- Several years have passed
- You hear concerning news about the doctor
- The doctor changes clinics or practice locations
- You have any reason for concern

**Q: What should I do if I discover a fake doctor?**

Report immediately to:
- Nepal Medical Council: verification@nmc.org.np or +977-1-4371954
- Local police if patients are at immediate risk
- Ministry of Health if the issue involves a hospital or clinic

Your report could prevent harm to other patients.

**Q: Can NMC certificates be fake?**

Yes, counterfeit certificates exist. This is exactly why you must verify on the official NMC website database. A framed certificate on the wall can be forged, but the NMC database is the authoritative source that cannot be faked.

**Q: Is it rude to ask my doctor for their NMC number?**

Absolutely not. Legitimate, ethical doctors understand that patients have every right to verify credentials. If a doctor becomes defensive or refuses, that itself is a warning sign. Professional doctors will gladly provide their NMC number.

**Q: The NMC portal shows my doctor's name, but how do I know if they're currently active?**

The NMC online portal doesn't display current status (active/suspended) or renewal dates. If you need to confirm current status:
- Contact NMC directly at verification@nmc.org.np or +977-1-4371954
- Ask the doctor to show their physical NMC certificate with renewal date
- Check if they're associated with reputable hospitals or medical institutions
- Use RankSewa's verified profiles which undergo additional verification checks

## How RankSewa Makes Doctor Verification Easier

While the official NMC website is the authoritative source for verification, it has significant limitations:
- **Name search often doesn't work** - you need the exact NMC number
- **No status information** - doesn't show if doctor is currently active or suspended
- **No dates shown** - can't see when registered or last renewed
- **Basic information only** - just name, NMC number, and qualification
- **No patient reviews or ratings**
- **Doesn't help you compare doctors**
- **No contact or location information**

### RankSewa Addresses These Limitations

**Pre-Verified Doctor Profiles**

Every doctor with a "Verified" badge on RankSewa has had their NMC registration cross-checked. The NMC number is displayed prominently on their profile, making it easy for you to verify independently if desired.

**Comprehensive Information in One Place**

Beyond just NMC verification, you get:
- Real patient reviews and ratings from actual patients
- Years of experience in practice
- Specialization areas and conditions treated
- Clinic locations, hours, and contact information
- Educational background and qualifications
- Hospital affiliations

**Easy Search and Comparison**

- Search by medical condition: "best cardiologist in Kathmandu"
- Filter by city, specialty, or hospital
- Compare multiple doctors side-by-side
- Read experiences from other patients

**Transparency and Accountability**

By displaying NMC numbers publicly, RankSewa promotes transparency in Nepal's healthcare system. Doctors know their credentials are visible, encouraging accountability and professionalism.

**Always Up-to-Date**

Doctors can update their profiles with new qualifications, clinic locations, or contact information. This means you're getting current information, not outdated directory listings.

**Visit RankSewa.com to find verified doctors in your area and read real patient reviews.**

## Protecting Yourself and Your Family

The cases of fake doctors discovered in Nepal aren't isolated incidents. They represent a systemic issue that requires patient vigilance. With 109 doctors found using fake certificates and multiple documented cases of illegal practice, verification isn't paranoia—it's responsible healthcare decision-making.

2. **Save their registration information** for your records
3. **Share this guide** with family and friends
4. **Use verified platforms** like RankSewa when choosing new doctors

- ✅ A few minutes of verification can prevent years of consequences
- ✅ Your health and safety are more important than social awkwardness

### The Bottom Line
