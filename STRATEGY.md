# RankSewa Growth Strategy

## Current Status (Jan 2026)
- **Doctors:** 24,070 imported
- **Reviews:** 1 (from early adopter dentist)
- **Traffic:** ~0 organic visitors
- **Claimed profiles:** 1
- **Stage:** MVP / Cold Start Problem

## Key Insight: Doctors Don't Care Yet (And That's Normal)

### Why 95k Doctor Facebook Group = 0 Clicks
- **No traffic = no value** for doctors
- Doctors fear reviews, not seek them
- No incentive to claim profiles without patient traffic
- That one dentist was an outlier (early adopters = 2-3%)

### The Critical Strategic Error
❌ Marketing to supply side (doctors) when you have zero demand (patients)
✅ Should focus on demand side (patients) first

**Truth:** Patients WANT doctor reviews. Doctors DON'T want to be reviewed (until competitors do).

## The Right Strategy: Ignore Doctors for 90 Days

### Stop Doing:
- Posting in doctor Facebook groups
- Trying to convince doctors to claim profiles
- Expecting doctors to engage without traffic

### Start Doing:
- Build patient traffic through content
- Get patients searching for doctors
- Let traffic create doctor FOMO

## Content Strategy: Patient-Focused Articles (Next 90 Days)

### Article Ideas - Health Condition Guides
- "How to Find a Good Cardiologist in Kathmandu: What to Look For"
- "Diabetes Management in Nepal: Finding the Right Doctor"
- "Women's Health: Choosing an OBGYN in Pokhara"
- "Finding a Pediatrician in Lalitpur: Parent's Guide"
- "Mental Health Services in Nepal: Breaking the Stigma"

- "How to Verify Your Doctor's NMC Credentials Online"
- "Patient Rights in Nepal: What You Need to Know"

### Article Ideas - Local Healthcare News

- Healthcare cost comparisons
- Hospital quality reports
- Medical tourism in Nepal

### Target Keywords (What Patients Actually Search)
- "best cardiologist kathmandu"
- "gynecologist pokhara reviews"
- "diabetes doctor biratnagar"
- "pediatrician lalitpur"
- "how long wait doctor nepal"
- "cheapest hospital kathmandu"
- "doctor review nepal"

## Distribution Strategy

### ❌ DON'T Post In:
- Doctor Facebook groups (they don't care)
- Medical professional forums
- Hospital administrator groups

### ✅ DO Post In:
1. **Reddit r/Nepal** - Ask "What's your experience with doctors in Nepal?"
2. **Local Facebook groups** - "Kathmandu Community", "Pokhara Residents", "Expats in Nepal"
3. **Nepali Twitter** - #NepalHealthcare #KathmanduHealth
4. **Quora** - Answer questions about finding doctors in Nepal
5. **Your own network** - WhatsApp groups, family, friends

## When Doctors Will Start Caring

Doctors claim profiles when they see:

### Traffic Milestone
"Dr. Sharma, your profile had 847 views last month"
- Now claiming makes sense - patients are looking

### Competitor Pressure
"Dr. Sharma, Dr. Patel claimed his profile and has 12 reviews"
- FOMO kicks in

### Patient Inquiries
Patients calling: "I saw you on RankSewa"
- Direct ROI

**None of this exists yet. That's why doctors ignore you.**

## SEO Timeline (Realistic Expectations)

- **Week 1-4:** Google barely indexes articles
- **Month 1-2:** Articles appear on page 5-10 (nobody sees)
- **Month 3-4:** Articles climb to page 2-3 (some traffic)
- **Month 6+:** Articles hit page 1 (real traffic begins)

**You're at Day 1 of a 6-month SEO journey.**

## Pricing Tiers: TOO EARLY

### You Need FIRST:
- 5,000-10,000 monthly visitors
- 100+ reviews across 50+ doctors
- 20-30 doctors actively using free features
- Doctors asking "how do I get more visibility?"

### Then Offer:
- Premium badge
- Featured placement
- Analytics dashboard
- Patient lead notifications

**Right now:** 0 traffic + 0 reviews = nobody will pay

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Week 1-4: Content Marathon
- Write 2-3 articles per week (8-12 total)
- Focus on patient pain points
- Target long-tail keywords
- **Goal:** 50-100 monthly visitors

### Week 5-8: Distribution
- Post in patient Facebook groups
- Answer Quora questions
- Engage on r/Nepal
- Build email list
- **Goal:** 200-500 monthly visitors

### Week 9-12: First Patient Reviews
- Ask network to review recent doctor visits
- Target 20-30 reviews from real experiences
- Even friends/family counts
- **Goal:** 500-1,000 monthly visitors

### Month 3-4: Doctor Outreach (Finally!)
- Reach out to doctors WITH traffic data
- "Dr. X, you had 437 profile views, want to claim?"
- Now they have incentive
- **Goal:** 10-20 claimed profiles

## When RankSewa Graduates from MVP

### Product-Market Fit Signals (6-12 months)
- **Traffic:** 5,000-10,000 monthly organic visitors
- **Reviews:** 100+ authentic reviews across 50+ doctors
- **Doctor engagement:** 20-50 doctors claimed profiles

### Network Effects Start (12-18 months)
- Patients search → find reviews → write their own
- Doctors see views → claim profile → ask patients to review
- Good doctors rise → attract patients
- **Growth happens while you sleep**

### Specific Indicators You're Beyond MVP
- ✅ Week 1: Doctor you never contacted claims profile
- ✅ Month 3: Patient writes review without being asked
- ✅ Month 6: Someone shares your article organically
- ✅ Month 12: Doctor asks "how do I get more reviews?"
- ✅ Month 18: Competing platform launches (validation!)
- ✅ **BIG ONE:** Hospital contacts YOU to advertise

## Key Metrics to Track

### Month 0-3 (Now - Pure MVP)
- Monthly visitors: 100 → 500 → 1,000
- Articles published: 20-30
- Reviews: 20-30
- Claimed profiles: 1-5

### Month 3-6 (Early Traction)
- Monthly visitors: 1,000 → 2,000 → 5,000
- Reviews: 50+
- Claimed profiles: 10-20
- Some organic growth

### Month 6-12 (Product-Market Fit Search)
- Monthly visitors: 5,000-10,000
- Reviews: 100-200
- Claimed profiles: 20-50
- Network effects visible

### Month 12-18 (Beyond MVP)
- Monthly visitors: 10,000+
- Reviews: 200-500
- Claimed profiles: 50-100
- Doctors claiming without outreach

## The Brutal Truth

**Most startups stay in MVP mode for 18-24 months before real traction.**

Two-sided marketplaces are especially hard because you need BOTH sides engaged.

**That 95k group with 0 clicks is the BEST feedback:**
- ✅ Doctors are not your customer (patients are)
- ✅ Social media won't work for B2B doctor marketing
- ✅ You need patient-first growth strategy
- ✅ Traffic first, then doctors will come

## Next Actions

**For Next 90 Days:**
1. Write 20-30 patient-focused articles (2-3/week)
2. Get 30-50 real reviews from your network
3. Stop marketing to doctors entirely
4. Track GA daily (don't expect magic for 60-90 days)
5. Build patient community (Facebook group "Nepal Healthcare Experiences"?)

**Then Around Month 3-4:**
- You'll have 1,000-3,000 monthly visitors
- 30-50 reviews
- Some doctors showing up in Google
- **Then** reach out to those doctors with traffic data

**That's when doctors will care.**
