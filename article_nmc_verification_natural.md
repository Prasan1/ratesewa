# How to Verify Your Doctor's NMC Number Online

**Last updated:** January 9, 2026

---

If you're seeing a doctor in Nepal, you have every right to know they're actually qualified to practice medicine. The problem is, most patients have no idea how to check.

Here's the thing: every legitimate doctor in Nepal has a Nepal Medical Council (NMC) registration number. It's basically their license to practice. And you can verify it online in about 5 minutes.

This guide will show you how.

## Why This Matters

Look, I get it. When you're sick, the last thing you want to do is play detective with your doctor's credentials. But here's why it's worth the effort:

The NMC is the only official body that registers doctors in Nepal. If a doctor doesn't have an NMC number, they're either:
- Not qualified to practice medicine
- Using someone else's credentials
- Breaking the law

An NMC registration doesn't tell you if a doctor is good at their job—that's where patient reviews come in. But it does confirm they're legally allowed to practice.

## How to Check NMC Numbers

### Method 1: The Official NMC Website

This is the most reliable way:

1. Go to [nmc.org.np](https://www.nmc.org.np)
2. Look for the "Registered Doctors" or "Verification" section
3. Search by the doctor's name or NMC number

You'll see their full name, registration number, qualifications, and specialization if they have one.

**Fair warning:** The NMC website can be slow and the search function isn't always great. You might need to try different spelling variations.

### Method 2: Check on RankSewa

We display NMC numbers on verified doctor profiles. Look for the green "Verified" badge and the NMC number listed on their profile.

But here's the important part: we recommend you still verify independently through the NMC website. We do our best to keep information accurate, but we're not the official source.

### Method 3: Just Ask Your Doctor

Seriously. Ask to see their NMC registration certificate. Any legitimate doctor should have it displayed in their clinic or be happy to show it to you.

If they get defensive or refuse? That's a red flag.

## What NMC Numbers Look Like

NMC numbers follow a format like: NMC-12345

The number tells you when the doctor registered. Lower numbers mean they registered earlier (which often, but not always, means more experience). Higher numbers mean they registered more recently.

One thing to note: registration date doesn't equal years of experience. Some doctors practice abroad before registering with NMC.

## When You Can't Find a Doctor's NMC Number

There are a few legitimate reasons you might not find a doctor in the NMC database:

**Name variations:** Try searching without "Dr." or with different spellings. Some doctors use shortened versions of their names.

**Recent registration:** Very new registrations might take time to show up online.

**They're not actually registered:** This is the scenario you're worried about. If you've tried multiple searches and variations and still can't find them, that's concerning.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Here's when you should be worried:

- No NMC certificate displayed anywhere in the clinic
- Refuses to provide their NMC number when asked
- The NMC number doesn't match their name in the database
- Claims to be a specialist but NMC records show only basic qualifications
- Found in NMC records but listed as suspended or struck off

If you encounter any of these, get a second opinion from a verified doctor.

## What About Specialists?

If your doctor claims to be a specialist (cardiologist, neurologist, etc.), they should have:

1. Basic medical degree (MBBS)
2. NMC registration
3. Specialist qualification (MD, MS, or equivalent in their field)
4. Specialization listed in NMC records

Some doctors practice in specialized fields after short training courses but don't have formal specialist degrees. This isn't illegal, but it's something you should know when choosing a specialist.

## Common Questions

**Can doctors practice without NMC registration?**
No. It's illegal. Even foreign doctors need to register with NMC to practice in Nepal.

**Are dentists registered with NMC?**
Yes. Dentists with BDS degrees are also registered with the Nepal Medical Council.

**What about Ayurvedic doctors?**
They're registered with a different body—the Nepal Ayurved Medical Council (NAMC). BAMS doctors have their own registry.

**How often do doctors renew their NMC registration?**
NMC registration requires periodic renewal. Doctors must maintain active registration to practice legally.

## Beyond the Paperwork

Look, verifying NMC credentials is important. But it's just the starting point.

Once you know a doctor is legitimate, you still need to figure out if they're any good. That's where patient reviews become crucial. Read what other patients say about:
- How long they waited for appointments
- Whether the doctor listened to their concerns
- If treatment actually helped
- Whether they felt rushed or properly cared for

On RankSewa, we let you filter by verified doctors AND read real patient experiences. Because you deserve both credentials and quality.

## What to Do Now

If you're seeing a doctor regularly and have never checked their NMC number, take 5 minutes to verify it. It's a simple step that protects you.

If you discover your doctor isn't registered (or worse, is suspended), find a verified alternative immediately.

And if you've had a good experience with a verified doctor? Leave a review to help other patients.
