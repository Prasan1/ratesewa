# When to See a Doctor in Nepal: A Guide to General Health Checkups

## Why Annual Checkups Matter

Many Nepalis only visit a doctor when they're sick. But waiting until you have symptoms means missing the chance to catch problems early - when they're easier and cheaper to treat.

Annual health checkups can detect:
- High blood pressure (the "silent killer")
- Early diabetes before symptoms appear
- High cholesterol before it damages your heart
- Vitamin deficiencies common in Nepal (Vitamin D, B12)
- Early signs of thyroid problems

## What Happens During a General Checkup?

A typical checkup with a General Physician includes:

**Basic Examination**:
- Blood pressure measurement
- Weight and BMI calculation
- Heart and lung examination with stethoscope
- Abdominal examination
- Review of your medical history

**Blood Tests** (usually recommended annually after age 30):
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Blood sugar (fasting glucose or HbA1c)
- Lipid profile (cholesterol levels)
- Thyroid function tests
- Kidney and liver function tests

**Additional Tests** based on age and risk factors:
- ECG for heart rhythm
- Chest X-ray if you smoke or have respiratory symptoms
- Eye examination for diabetes patients

## Who Needs Regular Checkups?

**Everyone over 30** should have annual checkups. Earlier if you have:

- Family history of diabetes, heart disease, or cancer
- Overweight or obesity
- Sedentary job or lifestyle
- Smoking or tobacco use
- High stress levels
- Previous health issues

**After 40**: More comprehensive testing recommended including prostate (men) and breast/cervical screening (women)

**After 50**: Colonoscopy screening, bone density tests, and cardiac stress tests may be recommended

- Note family medical history

**During the appointment**:
- Be honest about your lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet)
- Ask questions about anything you don't understand
- Discuss any symptoms, even if they seem minor
- Ask for a written summary of findings
